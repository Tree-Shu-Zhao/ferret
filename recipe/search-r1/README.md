# Search-R1

Search-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework designed for training reasoning-and-searching interleaved LLMsâ€”language models that learn to reason and make tool calls (e.g., to search engines) in a coordinated manner.

## Usage

### Data Preparation

```bash
bash recipe/search-r1/data_preprocess_search_r1.sh
```

### Training

Train a Search-R1 model with Qwen2.5-3B:

```bash
bash recipe/search-r1/train_search-r1_ppo_qwen2.5-3b-instruct.sh
```

### Evaluation

```bash
bash recipe/search-r1/eval_search-r1.sh
```
